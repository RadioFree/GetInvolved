# Introduction

Radio Free follows these guidelines as a template for how to best practice the dissemination of information for journalistic institutions in the 21st century and beyond.  These guides are meant to help highlight the best practices, tactics, and strategies for mediators of information (the media) to help protect journalists, their ideas, and their rights.  We define a journalist as anyone publishing information in the public interest.  We consider music, art, theatre, film, blogs, and other expressive outlets as great sources for fully understanding topics from different perspectives. We welcome the idea that these non-traditional news sources can be just as, if not more, effective at informing and reaching people.  We encourage news and information to be submitted from all perspectives, but have strict guidelines against publishing hate speech, sexist, racist, content, advertisments, information that threatens the first ammendment, and information that intends to be misleading.
