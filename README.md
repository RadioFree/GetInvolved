# Introduction

Radio Free follows these guidelines as a template for how to best practice the dissemination and managment of information. These guides are meant to help highlight the best practices, tactics, and strategies for mediators of information (the media) to help disseminate information while helping protect journalists, their ideas, their sources, and everyones rights. We define a journalist as anyone publishing information in the public interest. We consider music, art, theatre, film, blogs, and other expressive outlets as great sources for fully understanding topics from different perspectives. We welcome the idea that these non-traditional news sources can be just as, if not more, effective at informing and reaching people than traditional news formats. We encourage news and information to be submitted from all perspectives, but have strict guidelines against publishing hate speech, sexist and racist content, advertisments, information that threatens the basic human rights of expression and speech, and information that intends to be misleading or intentioanlly confusing for readers. 


# Tools

Radio Free makes tools for journalists, always open source, and always free to use. These tools are made as needed and new tools can be requested in the chatroom. We invite others to contribute to our projects on Github.com/RadioFree.

# Tactics

Getting information from a source to an audience takes strategy. We invite anyone to use our content (radiofree.org) to help spread the word about news in their community.  

## Print
We created a plugin for WordPress that once installed, allows you to print any post in the Radio Free style. The plugin adds a print button to the bottom of each post, which creates a print friendly version of the page including in-line annotations for links so that sources are kept transparent. github.com/radiofree/print


# Editors

To become an editor on Radio Free, we require you to maintain at least 20 published submissions on radiofree.org and be an active (active = contributing by posting or editing at least once every two months) member of our editorial community. Make an account on radiofree.org to get started. Once you have at least 20 published articles you can email info@radiofree.org and request to be an editor.  This process ensures our platform stays protected from malicious edits, while also providing a training period for new and seasoned editors to the Radio Free guidelines. 

# Contributors

There are infinite ways to contribute to Radio Free.  Below are just a few of the most common ways people get involved. If there are projects or ideas you have that are not listed below, suggest an idea to an editor in the Discussion chat on the WordPress Dashboard of radiofree.org. You can also email ideas to info@radiofree.org.

## Publishers
Anyone can submit content to be published. Here's a guide that helps explain how to get started. Feel free to use this to train others too. https://www.radiofree.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Radio-Free-How-to-Get-Started.pdf

We maintain strict guidelines against publishing hate speech, sexist and/or racist content, advertisments (with the exception being unpaid advertisments that promote art, which we define as the perception of expression), information that threatens the first ammendment and freedom of the press, and information that intends to be misleading. These guidelines should be constantly revisited to ensure they meet the everchanging needs of people and news publishers. 

We ask that when you create content, you keep track of all people who contributed to that content being created. Please add their names somewhere in the article where it is most approproiate for them to be recognized. For any media added to the media library, we ask that you add the contributors names to that media within the "captions" field on WordPress.  

## Best Practice for Preparing Content

### Text

When contributing written material, please try to link any words that readers might not be familiar with to a source that explains those words.  Wikipedia is a great resource for this, but any reliable source that explains the word or phrase is acceptable to use. Please do not use any shortlink or link forwarding services for these links (like bit.ly), as this will help our readers more easily be able to tell where the link is directing them.  

It is important to write for accessability, so this means writing about complicated topics so that both a new student to english and a distinguished english professor can easily understand what the topic is about without having to rely on other sources. A good rule of thumb for adhearing to this is being able to read the article and only rely on links embedded in the text for context to understand the ideas being presented. If the user has to search for terms, names, etc... without being able to click a link to just be able to understand the article, it needs more context. Too many links can confuse the reader, so keeping a balance between providing links for context and using textual descriptors should be the goal. If it can be explained easily with just a few words without a link, there is no need to add the link.

Use whatever style for citations you want, but please try to provide links when adding digital sources. This helps ensure our feeds are formatted a bit cleaner, which is important to keep in mind when writing.  If you add code, make sure it doesnt break the site by previewing you post before you submit work.

### Photography

Photos and other images should always try to provide a textual description of what is happening in the photo, who is depicted in the image, where the image took place, and when the photo was taken.  This can be added to the "Captions" section of the photo when uploading in the Media Library.  

#### Example of an image caption:

<img width="400px" src="/images/Person Fishing - Alora Griffiths.jpg">
A person [If necessary, include a name of the person] standing in front of a stone bridge with a fishing rod on December 11, 2019 at 10:43 AM in London, England.  Photo taken by Alora Griffiths. [The filename should reflect the photo and incorporate the author's name when possible.]

### Audio / Video

When contributing audio or video, try to post a description of the audio including any lyrics or ideas behind the audio so listeners know what they are hearing. Creating a textual description of audio is easy to do.  You should think about the sounds you are hearing, and how those components interact. Likewise, if a component of the visuals in a video are not properly documented, please try to provide a textual description.  

#### A sample description of the sounds of a tree being cut down:

Chainsaws buzz in the bacground while the sound of a large cherry tree falling down makes a cracking sound before it makes a loud crashing thud when hitting the ground.

#### A sample description of a tree falling in a forest with no audio:

A tall oak tree falls in a forest without making a sound

#### A sample description of a concert:

The band Rage Against The Machine combines drums, electric bass, electric guitar with vocals to create a blend of punk rock, reggae, funk and hip hop, for the song Guerilla Radio which highlights the topics of activism, pirate radio and free speech through the captioned lyrics: [List the full lyrics in the "Caption" section of the Media Library for the post]

# Activism

We encourage everyone in the community to take a stand on issues they feel strongly about.  We are working on guides (found below) to be able to aide in grassroots marketing efforts for people, not profits. With this in mind, we ask that you not use these tools for commercial purposes and that you not take any money from corporations when you do use these tools for things.  This ensures these will be used for the public interest, not corporate interests.  If you have any questions about these permissions, please email info@radiofree.org for clarification. 

## How to Wheatpaste

Wheatpasting is a form of expression where paper is brushed with a form of glue like paste that stucks to most surfaces. It can be easily made and is extremely cheap.  You can make wheatpaste so many different ways, from just mixing glue and water (fing a ratio that works, more water than glue), to traditional methods like putting a 1/4 cup of flour in a gallon of water and boiling it for 5 minutes (which makes a perfect slurry to hold paper on any surface naturally).

### Step One - Choose a paste

#### Flour Method

This method is super simple and the most accessible for everyone. All you need is flour and water.  Boil 1 gallon of water. In a seperate cup, mix 1/4 cup of flour into roughly 3 cups of room temperature water.  Mix this until it is combined, then mix it into the boiling water and stir on mediium heat for 2-3 minutes. Let it cool.

#### Glue Method

Mix basic white school glue with water, the ratio is up to you, but maybe start with a 80 Water/20 Glue ratio. Mix the two together and thats it, you're ready.

### Step Two - Choose a wall

You can use printable versions of Articles on Radio Free to spread the word about the news.  Print the article out and paste it on a wall that gets a lot of foot traffic so it will be seen.  One simple method is to take a plastic squeezable bottle and load it with your paste. Then simply squirt some on the wall, push the paper into it, and once it sticks, squirt some more and press it firmly with a dishrag.
