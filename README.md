# Introduction

Radio Free follows these guidelines as a template for how to best practice the dissemination of information for journalistic institutions in the 21st century and beyond.  These guides are meant to help highlight the best practices, tactics, and strategies for mediators of information (the media) to help disseminate information while helping protect journalists, their ideas, and their rights.  We define a journalist as anyone publishing information in the public interest.  We consider music, art, theatre, film, blogs, and other expressive outlets as great sources for fully understanding topics from different perspectives. We welcome the idea that these non-traditional news sources can be just as, if not more, effective at informing and reaching people.  We encourage news and information to be submitted from all perspectives, but have strict guidelines against publishing hate speech, sexist, racist, content, advertisments, information that threatens the first ammendment, and information that intends to be misleading. 


# Tools

Radio Free makes tools for journalists, always open source, and always free to use. These tools are made on an as needed and new tools can be requested by emailing a detailed description of what is needed to info@radiofree.org. We invite others to contribute to our projects on Github.com/RadioFree where all tools live. 


# Tactics

Getting information from a source to an audience takes many forms. We invite anyone to use our content (radiofree.org) to help spread the word about news in their community.  

## Print
We created a plugin for WordPress that once installed, allows you to print any post in the Radio Free style.  The plugin adds a print button to the bottom of each post, which creates a print friendly version of the page including in-line annotations for links so that sources are kept transparent.  github.com/radiofree/print


# Editors

To become an editor on Radio Free, we require you to maintain at least 20 published submissions on radiofree.org and be an active (active = contributing by posting or editing at least once every two months) member of our editorial community.  Make an account on radiofree.org to get started.  Once you have at least 20 published articles you'll see a button labled "Editorial Application" on the dashboard which you'll need to submit to be able to begin editing content.  This process ensures our platform stays protected from malicious edits, while also providing a training period for new and seasoned editors to the Radio Free guidelines. 



# Contributors

Anyone can submit content to be published. We ask that you submit content by creating an account on radiofree.org and submitting by using the WordPress editor.  If you're unfamiliar with using WordPress, email info@radiofree.org and we can answer any questions not easily answered on wordpress.org or simply searching the internet. 

Our editors are trained to maintain strict guidelines against publishing hate speech, sexist and/or racist content, advertisments (which will be stripped automatically when possible), information that threatens the first ammendment and freedom of the press, and information that intends to be misleading. These guidelines are constantly revisited by our editorial team to ensure they meet the everychanging needs of people and news publishers in the future. If you are unsure why a certain post was taken down or rejected, please email info@radiofree.org so that we can try to explain the reasons behind our decision.  

We ask that when you create content, you keep track of all people who contributed to that content being created.  Please add their names somewhere in the article where it it most approproiate for them to be recognized.  For any media added to the media library, we ask that you add the contributors names to that media within the "captions" field on WordPress.  


### Audio

When contributing audio, post a description of the audio including any lyrics or ideas behind the audio so listeners know what they are hearing. Creating a textual description of audio is easy to do.  You should think about the sounds you are hearing, and how those components interact. 

A sample description for audio of the sounds of a tree getting cut down:

Chainsaws buzz in the bacground while the sound of a large cherry tree falling down makes a cracking sound before it makes a loud crashing thud when hitting the ground.


A sample description for audio of a concert:

The band Rage Against The Machine combines drums, electric bass, electric guitar with vocals to create a blend of punk rock, reggae, funk and hip hop, for the song Guerilla Radio which highlights the topics of activism, pirate radio and free speech through these lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Transmission, third World War, third round
A decade of the weapon of sound above ground
No shelter if you're looking for shade
I lick shots at the brutal charade
As the polls close like a casket, on truth devoured
A silent play on the shadow of power
A spectacle monopolized
The camera's eyes on choice disguised
Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
Yes, a spectacle monopolized
They hold the reins, stole your eyes
All the Fistagons, the bullets, and bombs
Who stuff the banks, who staff the party ranks
More for Gore, or the son of a drug lord
None of the above, fuck it, cut the cord!

[Chorus]
Lights out, guerrilla radio!
Turn that shit up!
Lights out, guerrilla radio!
Turn that shit up!
Lights out, guerrilla radio!
Turn that shit up!
Lights out, guerrilla radio!

[Verse 2]
Contact, I hijacked the frequencies
Blockin' the beltway, move on DC!
Way past the days of bombin' MCs'
Sound off, Mumia go on be free!
Who got 'em? Yo, check the federal file
All you pendejos know the trial was vile
An army of pigs try to silence my style
Off 'em all out that box, it's my radio dial!

[Chorus]
Lights out, guerrilla radio!
Turn that shit up!
Lights out, guerrilla radio!
Turn that shit up!
Lights out, guerrilla radio!
Turn that shit up!
Lights out, guerrilla radio!
Turn that shit up!

[Bridge]
It has to start somewhere
It has to start sometime
What better place than here?
What better time than now?

[Outro]
All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now
