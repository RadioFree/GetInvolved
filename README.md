# Introduction

Radio Free follows these guidelines as a template for how to best practice the dissemination of information for journalistic institutions in the 21st century. These guides are meant to help highlight the best practices, tactics, and strategies for mediators of information (the media) to help disseminate information while helping protect journalists, their ideas, and their rights.  We define a journalist as anyone publishing information in the public interest.  We consider music, art, theatre, film, blogs, and other expressive outlets as great sources for fully understanding topics from different perspectives. We welcome the idea that these non-traditional news sources can be just as, if not more, effective at informing and reaching people.  We encourage news and information to be submitted from all perspectives, but have strict guidelines against publishing hate speech, sexist, racist, content, advertisments, information that threatens the first ammendment, and information that intends to be misleading. 


# Tools

Radio Free makes tools for journalists, always open source, and always free to use. These tools are made on an as needed and new tools can be requested by emailing a detailed description of what is needed to info@radiofree.org. We invite others to contribute to our projects on Github.com/RadioFree where all tools live. 


# Tactics

Getting information from a source to an audience takes many forms. We invite anyone to use our content (radiofree.org) to help spread the word about news in their community.  

## Print
We created a plugin for WordPress that once installed, allows you to print any post in the Radio Free style.  The plugin adds a print button to the bottom of each post, which creates a print friendly version of the page including in-line annotations for links so that sources are kept transparent.  github.com/radiofree/print


# Editors

To become an editor on Radio Free, we require you to maintain at least 20 published submissions on radiofree.org and be an active (active = contributing by posting or editing at least once every two months) member of our editorial community.  Make an account on radiofree.org to get started.  Once you have at least 20 published articles you'll see a button labled "Editorial Application" on the dashboard which you'll need to submit to be able to begin editing content.  This process ensures our platform stays protected from malicious edits, while also providing a training period for new and seasoned editors to the Radio Free guidelines. 



# Contributors

There are infinite ways to contribute to Radio Free.  Below are just a few of the most common ways people get involved.  If there are projects or ideas you have that are not listed below, suggest an idea to an editor in the Discussion chat on the WordPress Dashboard of radiofree.org.  You can also email ideas to info@radiofree.org.

## Publishers
Anyone can submit content to be published. We ask that you submit content by creating an account on radiofree.org and submitting by using the WordPress editor, which can be accessed by clicking the "Home" icon on the WordPress Admin Bar when logged in, and then clicking on "Posts" on the left hand column.  If you're unfamiliar with using WordPress, email info@radiofree.org and we can answer any questions not easily answered on wordpress.org or simply searching the internet. Wordpress.org is a gret place to get started understanding how to use WordPress.

Our editors are trained to maintain strict guidelines against publishing hate speech, sexist and/or racist content, advertisments (with the exception being unpaid advertisments that promote free expression, such as a concert or art show), information that threatens the first ammendment and freedom of the press, and information that intends to be misleading. These guidelines are constantly revisited by our editorial team to ensure they meet the everychanging needs of people and news publishers in the future. If you are unsure why a certain post was taken down or rejected, please email info@radiofree.org so that we can try to explain the reasons behind the decision, or reverse the decision if it was made by in poor judgment.  

We ask that when you create content, you keep track of all people who contributed to that content being created.  Please add their names somewhere in the article where it it most approproiate for them to be recognized.  For any media added to the media library, we ask that you add the contributors names to that media within the "captions" field on WordPress.  

## Best Practice for Preparing Content

### Words

When contributing written material, please try to link any words that readers might not be familiar with to a source that explains those words.  Wikipedia is a great resource for this, but any reliable source that explains the word or phrase is acceptable to use. Please do not use any shortlink or link forwarding services for these links (like bit.ly), as this will help our readers more easily be able to tell where the link is directing them.  

It is important to write for accessability, so this means writing about complicated topics so that both a teenager and distinguished professor can easily understand what the topic is about without having to rely on other sources.  A good rule of thumb for adhearing to this is being able to read the article and only rely on links embedded in the text for context to understand the ideas being presented.  If the user has to search for terms, names, etc... without being able to click a link to just be able to understand the article, it needs more context.   Too many links can confuse the reader, so keeping a balance between providing links for context and using textual descriptors is bes practice.  If it can be explained easily with just a few words without a link, there is no need to add the link.

### Photography

Photos and other images should always try to provide a textual description of what is happening in the photo, who is depicted in the image, where the image took place, and when the photo was taken.

### Audio / Video

When contributing audio or video, try to post a description of the audio including any lyrics or ideas behind the audio so listeners know what they are hearing. Creating a textual description of audio is easy to do.  You should think about the sounds you are hearing, and how those components interact. Likewise, if a component of the visuals in a video are not properly documented, please try to provide a textual description.  

#### A sample description of the sounds of a tree being cut down:

Chainsaws buzz in the bacground while the sound of a large cherry tree falling down makes a cracking sound before it makes a loud crashing thud when hitting the ground.

#### A sample description of a tree falling in a forest with no audio:

A tall oak tree falls in a forest without making a sound


#### A sample description of a concert:

The band Rage Against The Machine combines drums, electric bass, electric guitar with vocals to create a blend of punk rock, reggae, funk and hip hop, for the song Guerilla Radio which highlights the topics of activism, pirate radio and free speech through the captioned lyrics: [List the full lyrics in the "Caption" section of the Media Library for the post]
